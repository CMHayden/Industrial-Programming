# Industrial Programming

## Purpose and Learning Objectives

The purpose of the Course F21SC Industrial Programming is to deepen the understanding of a range of programming languages and to obtain a critical understanding of the outstanding features of each of the languages. In doing so, it provides advanced programming language skills, exercised through a series of courseworks. In particular, this course conveys the idea of scripting languages acting as glueware between components of existing software systems in order to build large systems.

**Assessment**

* Class test 30%
* Coursework 70%
    * Coursework 1 - C# - TBC
    * Coursework 2 - Python - TBC

**Learning Objectives:**

* Appreciation of role of different programming paradigms in configuring/managing systems:
* Object-oriented: good at structuring large code
* Imperative: good at performance
* Functional: good at abstraction
* Logic: good at reasoning
* Autonomous problem analysis/solution:
* Really understand the problem to pick the right paradigm/approach for producing a solution
* Understanding of core characteristics of contemporary operating systems: make good use of available resources
* Appreciation of role of language as glue wear in configuring/maintaining systems:
* Scripting languages combine existing code
* Knowledge of key abstractions across programming languages:
* Write reusable and maintainable code
* Technical proficiency in advanced techniques in different programming paradigms:
* Learn the Best of all Worlds

**Pre-requisites:**

Solid knowledge of an object-oriented language, eg. Java.
